## Why Understanding Still Matters: The Limits of AI-Driven Software Development

### Scenario 
Imagine, your research team has collected some data on the animal species found within plots of land at a study site.  

Download the data from here: [animals.csv](data/animals.csv)

The dataset is stored as a comma separated value (CSV) file. You can open the csv file in excel or a similar spreadsheet tool and have a look at the data. You'll see the variable names in the top row of the spreadsheet.   Each row holds information for a single animal, and the columns represent:


| Column           | Description                        |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| record\_id       | Unique id for the observation      |
| month            | month of observation               |
| day              | day of observation                 |
| year             | year of observation                |
| plot\_id         | ID of a particular plot            |
| species\_id      | 2-letter code                      |
| sex              | sex of animal (“M”, “F”)           |
| hindfoot\_length | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| weight           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| genus            | genus of animal                    |
| species          | species of animal                  |
| taxon            | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| plot\_type       | type of plot                       |

## Where does the data come from?

The data we're working with comes from the [Portal Project](https://portal.weecology.org/), a long-term ecological study being conducted near Portal, Arizona. Since 1977, the site has been used to study interactions between rodents, ants and plants.

For this scenario, we use a CSV file that is a subset of the teaching-focused Portal dataset. This version has been simplified by removing some of the complexities of the full dataset, making it more suitable for computational training and learning exercises.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Your colleague wants some plots of the data as quickly as possible so that she can present them at an upcoming seminar.  First, she has requested a plot of hindfoot length vs weight to explore whether these two variables are correlated, including only species with over 100 observations.  You know that Matplotlib is a plotting library in python but you're not quite sure how to use it, so you decide to ask AI to make the plot for you. 

Open an AI chat interface (such as ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot) and prompt the AI to:

'Generate some code to create a plot with weight on the x axis and hindfoot_length on the y axis, colour by species_id. Include only species with over 100 observations. The data is in a csv file called animals.csv.  Use Python and Matplotlib.' 

- Open anaconda navigator and launch jupyter notebooks. 
- Create a new folder 'animals_data_analysis'.
- Navigate to this folder.
- Drag and drop animals.csv into this folder.
- Create a new jupyter notebook in this folder called 'animals_plots'.
- Paste the AI-generated code into a code chunk in the Jupyter notebook and run the code.

We could even go one step further and upload the dataset to the AI chat so that the analysis can actually be run within the AI tool (depending on the features that you have access to with your AI tool). **Note: we can only do this because this dataset is publicly available. Don't upload any private or sensitive data.**

What are the problems with getting an AI tool to write your research code for you? Consider:

- Technical risks
- Reliability risks
- Ethical and academic integrity risks

Which additional problems are introduced when you also use AI to run the code?

Write your thoughts in the shared document.

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Artificial intelligence tools can generate code quickly and often convincingly. For researchers who are new to programming, this can be appealing: it may seem efficient to delegate the entire task of software development to an AI system. However, doing so without understanding the solution introduces significant technical, ethical, and reliability risks.

- AI-generated code may appear correct but can contain subtle errors, which may only appear under certain conditions. 
- If the researcher doesn't understand the AI-generated code they can't verify that the implementation matches the intended analysis and therefore they can't comprehensively defend their findings. 
- The same prompt may produce different solutions at different times, causing problems for reproducibility of your research.
- Generated code may rely on undocumented assumptions.
- Dependencies, versions, or defaults in AI-generated code may change without warning. 
- The researcher rather than the AI system will be held accountable for any errors in AI-generated code. When you use AI-generated code you don't fully understand, you risk being held accountable for any errors in that code. 
- Using AI-generated code that you don't fully understand limits research transparency, as you cannot explain your methods to reviewers and collaborators.
- Using code you do not understand may amount to overstating your expertise or control over the research process, and this misrepresentation is an academic integrity risk. 


### Additional Problems with AI also Runs the Code

- When AI runs code for you, the execution environment (hardware, operating system, library versions) may be opaque, making results hard to interpret or reproduce.
- The AI can hide warnings, errors, or suspicious behavior, increasing the likelihood that flawed results go unnoticed.
- Uploading data or running code through AI systems can reduce your control over how data is handled, including where it is stored, whether it is logged or reused, and how long it is retained. Without clear guarantees, data may persist beyond its intended use, whether temporarily in memory, in logs, or in backups, creating risks for confidentiality, compliance, and ethical oversight.
- When AI both generates and executes code, researchers may be more likely to trust outputs uncritically, reducing independent verification and scrutiny.

### Appropriate Roles for AI when Writing Research Code

AI tools can be highly valuable when used correctly, as a tool to assist you with your research. The key principle is that they should function as assistants, not autonomous developers.

Appropriate uses of AI include:

- Explaining unfamiliar concepts, terminology or programming frameworks.
- Helping you to spot bugs (problems) in your code and suggesting possible fixes.
- Writing boilerplate code (standard structures for functions, modules etc.)
- Supporting you to write technical documentation. 
- Helping to translate ideas into a starting implementation or prototype

In the rest of this episode, we'll walk through these ways that AI can assist you with coding. 

## Using AI to Understand Code and Technical Concepts 

AI tools like ChatGPT can serve as an interactive reference and tutor, helping you to understand unfamiliar coding constructs, libraries, or data analysis techniques. Unlike traditional search engines, AI can summarise and clarify technical information in context, tailored to your specific dataset, code, or research question.


- **Locate technical information quickly**: Instead of reading through multiple documentation pages, you can ask AI to find the relevant function, argument, or method for your task.
- **Summarise key concepts**: AI can condense long documentation into concise, understandable explanations. You can even ask AI to tailor explanations to you code and dataset. 
- **Clarify ambiguous points**: You can follow up iteratively, asking AI to rephrase explanations or provide examples.
- **Code comprehension**: Paste code generated by AI or colleagues and ask for line-by-line explanations.
- **Contextual learning**: Ask why certain functions or methods are used, what alternatives exist, and best practices.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Up-skill rather than De-skill with AI

1. Rather than asking AI to actually generate the code for the weight vs hindfoot length plot, instead ask for a step-by-step explanation of how you would do it with your preferred technologies and packages. 
e.g. “Explain how to filter a DataFrame in Python to include only species with more than 100 observations, and then plot hindfoot_length vs weight colored by species using MatplotLib.”

2. Take the code generated in the our example (plotting hindfoot_length vs weight) and ask AI:
“Explain what each line of this Python code does and why it is needed.”
Try iteratively refining questions: if a term or method is still unclear, ask AI to provide an example, an analogy, or reference documentation.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## Debugging and Error Analysis

**Scenario**:
A researcher has written the following Python code to plot weight vs hindfoot length by species using Matplotlib. When they try to run it, the code fails with an error. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("animals.csv")

# Count observations per species
species_counts = df["species_id"].value_counts()

# Keep only species with >100 observations
valid_species = species_counts[species_counts > 100].index
df_filtered = df[df["species_id"].isin(valid_species)]

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

for species, group in df_filtered.groupby("species_id"):
    plt.scatter(
        group["weight"],
        group["hindfoot_lenght"],
        label=species,
        alpha=0.7
    )

plt.xlabel("Weight")
plt.ylabel("Hindfoot Length")
plt.title("Hindfoot Length vs Weight (Species with >100 Observations)")
plt.legend(title="Species ID")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

```output
KeyError: 'hindfoot_lenght'
```

Try running the code above to check you get the same error.

Rather than asking AI to “fix the code,” the researcher could use it as a debugging assistant. 

For example, the researcher could enter the prompt “I am getting a KeyError: 'hindfoot_lenght' when running the following Python code that uses pandas and matplotlib. Can you help me understand what this error means and how to diagnose it?” 

This wording of the prompt will result in explanation rather than just a correction and substitution of the code and will help the researcher learn how to diagnose similar problems in future rather than becoming reliant on AI. 

Try it out using your AI tool.

In this example, AI might explain that:

- A KeyError in pandas means a column name does not exist
- The issue is likely a mismatch between the dataset’s column names and those referenced in the code

At this point, the researcher should verify this claim independently by inspecting the dataset's column names and checking for spelling inconsistencies.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## AI as a Debugging Assistant

The code below contains a different bug. Run the code, use AI to help you debug it, then apply the fix and verify that the code runs as expected. 

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the data
df = pd.read_csv("animal.csv")

# Count observations per species
species_counts = df["species_id"].value_counts()

# Keep only species with >100 observations
valid_species = species_counts[species_counts > 100].index
df_filtered = df[df["species_id"].isin(valid_species)]

# Create the plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

for species, group in df_filtered.groupby("species_id"):
    plt.scatter(
        group["weight"],
        group["hindfoot_length"],
        label=species,
        alpha=0.7
    )

plt.xlabel("Weight")
plt.ylabel("Hindfoot Length")
plt.title("Hindfoot Length vs Weight (Species with >100 Observations)")
plt.legend(title="Species ID")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```
:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

```output
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'animal.csv'
```

Prompt: I am getting the error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'animal.csv'. Can you help me understand what this error means and how to diagnose it?

The AI's output may include:
- This error is raised by Python when your code attempts to open a file that the operating system cannot locate at the specified path.
- The most common causes - the file is not in the current working directory, the filename is misspelled, the file path is incorrect, the file has not been created.

In this case the filename is misspelled as 'animal.csv' rather than 'animals.csv'.

## Code Generation


### Boilerplate

AI can be particularly useful for some coding tasks that are tedious and repetitive such as writing boilerplate code.

Boilerplate code is a term used to describe standard code structures that are repeated in multiple places with little variation. Examples of boilerplate code across a few different contexts include:

- Templates for function and class definitions
- Setup for plots in python or R
- Basic web page structure in HTML

Using AI to generate boilerplate code can save you time with minimal risk, allowing you to spend your time and effort focusing on the intent of the analysis rather than the programming language's syntax. 

For example let's try entering the prompt:
"Generate boilerplate code to load a csv file and create a histogram of one column"

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

# Create a histogram for a single column
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(df["column_name"], bins=30)
plt.xlabel("Column Values")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Histogram of Column Name")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

When you have the boilerplate code, you can edit it to give the desired outcome. For example, to produce a histogram of weight:

- Copy and paste the boilerplate into your jupyter notebook
- Read through the generated boilerplate to make sure it's doing what you expect
- Change the csv file name to `animals.csv`
- Change the column_name to `weight`

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv("animals.csv")

# Create a histogram for a single column
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(df["weight"], bins=30)
plt.xlabel("Column Values")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Histogram of Column Name")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```



### Documentation

Writing thorough code documentation can be time-consuming, which is why many scripts are left undocumented and can be hard to understand later, either by others or by yourself. AI can help by generating documentation automatically, making it faster to produce clear, understandable explanations of your code.

For example, if we extract plotting code into a function like `plot_species_scatter`, we can use AI to generate a docstring for the function. A **docstring** in Python is a short note written at the start of a function that explains what it does, what inputs the function takes, and what the function outputs.

Note that there are a few different styles of docstring for python: Google style , Sphinx style , NumPy style , and Epytext style. If the code you're working with follows a particular style, you can specify the style of docstring in your prompt.


```python
def plot_species_scatter(df, species_col="species_id", x_col="weight", y_col="hindfoot_length", min_count=100):
    df_filtered = filter_species_by_count(df, species_col, min_count)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    
    for species, group in df_filtered.groupby(species_col):
        plt.scatter(
            group[x_col],
            group[y_col],
            label=species,
            alpha=0.7
        )
    
    plt.xlabel(x_col.capitalize())
    plt.ylabel(y_col.replace("_", " ").capitalize())
    plt.title(f"{y_col.replace('_', ' ').capitalize()} vs {x_col.capitalize()} (Species with >{min_count} Observations)")
    plt.legend(title=species_col)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## Generate a Docstring

Copy and paste `plot_species_scatter` function from above into your AI tool and ask the AI to generate a docstring for the function.

If you know Python, verify that the docstring accurately represents what the code does.  More specifically, you could check that the listed parameters match the function’s arguments and confirm that any descriptions of functionality align with the actual code logic.  

If you don't know Python, read through the docstring and use it to help you understand what the function does. 

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Prompt: Generate a docstring for the following function: 

```python
def plot_species_scatter(df, species_col="species_id", x_col="weight", y_col="hindfoot_length", min_count=100):
    df_filtered = filter_species_by_count(df, species_col, min_count)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    
    for species, group in df_filtered.groupby(species_col):
        plt.scatter(
            group[x_col],
            group[y_col],
            label=species,
            alpha=0.7
        )
    
    plt.xlabel(x_col.capitalize())
    plt.ylabel(y_col.replace("_", " ").capitalize())
    plt.title(f"{y_col.replace('_', ' ').capitalize()} vs {x_col.capitalize()} (Species with >{min_count} Observations)")
    plt.legend(title=species_col)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

Example AI - generated docstring:

```python
    """
    Creates a scatter plot of two numerical variables for species with a minimum number of observations.
    
    The function filters the input DataFrame to include only species that have more than `min_count`
    observations, then plots `x_col` vs `y_col` for each species as separate scatter points with a legend.

    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame containing the data.
        species_col (str, optional): Column name representing species IDs. Defaults to "species_id".
        x_col (str, optional): Column name for the x-axis values. Defaults to "weight".
        y_col (str, optional): Column name for the y-axis values. Defaults to "hindfoot_length".
        min_count (int, optional): Minimum number of observations required for a species to be included. Defaults to 100.

    Returns:
        None. Displays a matplotlib scatter plot.
    
    Example:
        >>> plot_species_scatter(df, species_col="species_id", x_col="weight", y_col="hindfoot_length", min_count=50)
    """
```

## Which other coding tasks can benefit from AI assistance?

- Improving or optimising your code e.g. "Can you refactor this code to move the species-filtering logic into a small function, without changing its behaviour?"
- Generating first drafts or rapid prototypes
- Translating code between programming languages (Make sure you understand the translation so that you can troubleshoot, extend, or adapt it safely for future analyses!)

## Integrating AI Tools into IDEs

In this episode, we have used separate interfaces to interact with AI and to run our code.  As of 2025 this was the most common way that researchers interacted with AI for coding assistance.  However, it is also possible to integrate AI into an environment you use to write and run code (known as an Integrated Development Environment or IDE).  For example, an AI assistant called GitHub Copilot can be integrated IDEs such as Visual Studio Code.  There are some advantages and disadvantages to this integrated approach: 

### Advantages of using an IDE-Integrated AI Assistant

- **Context awareness**: Integrated AI can access the files and project structure in your IDE, making suggestions that are relevant to your current codebase.
- **Immediate feedback and autocompletion**: As well as the AI chat tool that we've been using in this session, IDE-integrated AI also offers autocompletion and code suggestions as you're typing. 
- **Seamless workflow**: You don't have to switch between windows or copy-paste code. Everything happens in one environment, which can reduce cognitive load.

### Disadvantages of using an IDE-Integrated AI Assistant

- **Limited explanation**: Unlike a standalone AI like ChatGPT, IDE-integrated AI often provides suggestions without detailed reasoning. This can reduce researchers' understanding of AI-generated code
- **Potential over-reliance**: It can be very tempting to accept AI code suggestions that appear to work, without fully understanding them, and this can lead to errors or misunderstandings about what your code does.
- **Privacy and security risks**: The AI may send code snippets to cloud services for processing. Sensitive data or unpublished research could be exposed if this is not carefully managed.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 
- Delegating full software development to AI without understanding the code introduces technical, ethical, and reliability risks.  
- AI tools should function as assistants, not autonomous developers, supporting learning, debugging, and code generation.  
- AI can be used as a reference tool to locate, summarise, and clarify technical information more efficiently than traditional search.  
- Researchers can use AI to explain unfamiliar code line by line, helping them understand programming constructs and libraries.  
- AI can assist with debugging by explaining errors and suggesting possible fixes, but researchers should independently verify solutions.  
- AI is useful for generating boilerplate code, performing basic refactoring, and drafting technical documentation, saving time on repetitive tasks.  
- AI can translate code between programming languages, but outputs must be reviewed for correctness, compatibility, and reproducibility.  
- Integrating AI into IDEs offers contextual suggestions and autocompletion, but carries risks of over-reliance, limited explanation, and potential privacy concerns.
